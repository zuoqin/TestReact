    Introduction: "<p><strong><em>“Thanks to advances in video surveillance, we’ve been able  to look inside Muslims’ homes and view some breathtaking calligraphy  prints and handwoven tapestries.” </em></strong>Saying they <strong>thoroughly enjoyed studying “such a lovely people and such a lovely faith,” </strong>Comey  explained that agents would often remove a Muslim citizen from their  community and keep them detained for days, weeks, or even months on end  to learn everything they could from them about Islam.</p>",
    Body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brexit-global-impact-by-anatole-kaletsky-2016-06\"><em>Authored by Anatole Kaletsky, originally posted at Project Syndicate,</em></a></p>\n<p>The febrile behavior of financial markets ahead of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s referendum on June 23 on whether to remain in the European Union shows that the<strong> outcome will influence economic and political conditions around the world far more profoundly than Britain&rsquo;s roughly <a href=\"https://www.quandl.com/collections/economics/gdp-as-share-of-world-gdp-at-ppp-by-country\" target=\"_blank\">2.4% share of global GDP</a> might suggest</strong>. There are three reasons for this outsize impact.</p>\n<p><u><strong>First, the &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; referendum is part of a global phenomenon: populist revolts against established political parties, predominantly by older, poorer, or less-educated voters angry enough to tear down existing institutions and defy &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; politicians and economic experts.</strong></u> Indeed, the demographic profile of potential Brexit voters is strikingly similar to that of American supporters of Donald Trump and French adherents of the National Front.</p>\n<p>Opinion polls <a href=\"https://next.ft.com/content/32414e3e-2804-11e6-8b18-91555f2f4fde\" target=\"_blank\">indicate</a> that British voters back the &ldquo;Leave&rdquo;campaign by a wide margin, 65% to 35%, if they did not complete high school, are over 60, or have &ldquo;D, E&rdquo; blue-collar occupations. By contrast, university graduates, voters under 40, and members of the &ldquo;A, B&rdquo; professional classes plan to vote &ldquo;Remain&rdquo; by similar margins of 60% to 40% and higher.</p>\n<p>In Britain, the United States, and Germany, the populist rebellions are not only fueled by similar perceived grievances and nationalist sentiments, but also are occurring in similar economic conditions. All three countries have returned to more or less full employment, with unemployment rates of around 5%. But many of the jobs created pay low wages, and immigrants have recently displaced bankers as scapegoats for all social ills.</p>\n<p>The degree of mistrust of business leaders, mainstream politicians, and expert economists is evident in the extent to which voters are ignoring their warnings not to endanger the gradual restoration of prosperity by upending the <em>status quo</em>. In Britain, after three months of debate about Brexit, only <a href=\"http://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/do-you-think-britain-would-be-better-or-worse-off-economically-if-it-left-the-eu/\" target=\"_blank\">37% of voters agree</a> that Britain would be worse off economically if it left the EU &ndash; down from 38% a year ago.</p>\n<p>In other words, all the voluminous reports &ndash; by the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the World Bank, and the British government and the Bank of England &ndash; unanimously warning of significant losses from Brexit have been disregarded. Rather than trying to rebut the experts&rsquo; warnings with detailed analyses, Boris Johnson, the leader of the Leave campaign, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/01/eu-referendum-live-vote-leave-remain-immigration\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> with bluster and rhetoric identical to Trump&rsquo;s anti-politics: &ldquo;Who is remotely apprehensive about leaving? Oh believe me, it will be fine.&rdquo; In other words, the so-called experts were wrong in the past, and they are wrong now.</p>\n<p>This kind of frontal attack on political elites has been surprisingly successful in Britain, judging by the latest Brexit polling. But only after the votes are counted will we know whether opinions expressed to pollsters predicted actual voting behavior.</p>\n<p><u><strong>This is the second reason why the Brexit result will echo around the world. The referendum will be the first big test of whether it is the experts and markets, or the opinion polls, that have been closer to the truth about the strength of the populist upsurge.</strong></u></p>\n<p>For now, political pundits and financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic assume, perhaps complacently, that what angry voters tell pollsters does not reflect how they will actually vote. Analysts and investors have consistently assigned low odds to insurgent victories: in late May, betting markets and computerized models put the probabilities of Trump&rsquo;s election and of Brexit at only around 25%, despite the fact that opinion polls showed almost 50% support for both.</p>\n<p>If Brexit wins on June 23, the low odds accorded by experts and financial markets to successful populist revolts in America and Europe will immediately look suspect, while the higher probabilities suggested by opinion polls will gain greater credibility. This is not because US voters will be influenced by Britain; of course they will not be. But, in addition to all the economic, demographic, and social similarities, opinion polling in the US and Britain now face very similar challenges and uncertainties, owing to the breakdown of traditional political allegiances and dominant two-party systems.</p>\n<p>Statistical theory even allows us to quantify how expectations about the US presidential election should shift if Brexit wins in Britain. Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that we start by giving equal credibility to opinion polls showing Brexit and Trump with almost 50% support and expert opinions, which gave them only a 25% chance. Now suppose that Brexit wins. A statistical formula called Bayes&rsquo; theorem then shows that belief in opinion polls would increase from 50% to 67%, while the credibility of expert opinion would fall from 50% to 33%.</p>\n<p><u><strong>This leads to the third, and most worrying, implication of the British vote. If Brexit wins in a country as stable and politically phlegmatic as Britain, financial markets and businesses around the world will be shaken out of their complacency about populist insurgencies in the rest of Europe and the US.</strong></u> These heightened market concerns will, in turn, change economic reality. As in 2008, financial markets will amplify economic anxiety, breeding more anti-establishment anger and fueling still-higher expectations of political revolt.</p>\n<p><em>The threat of such contagion means a Brexit vote could be the catalyst for another global crisis. This time, however, the workers who lose their jobs, the pensioners who lose their savings, and the homeowners who are trapped in negative equity will not be able to blame &ldquo;the bankers.&rdquo; Those who vote for populist upheavals will have no one but themselves to blame when their revolutions go wrong.</em></p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Frightened yet? Don&#39;t be - remember, the central banks said they would &quot;provide enough liquidity&quot; to rescue the world... or will they? Is Brexit an event that needs to be allowed in order to show the paeons just how bad things get when they don&#39;t toe-the-line?</p>\n\n\n</div>\n"

    Body: "<p>While by now practically every bank has forecast how the market would react to a Brexit vote, either to say or leave, nobody has quite come as close to dramatic forecast revealed by Morgan Stanley analysts overnight.

MSCI Europe鈥檚 N12M PE is 14x today and has averaged 15x over the last 3M. This compares to our expectation of a 5-10% rally if the UK votes to remain in the EU.

This assumption is smaller than the 11% decline in EPS seen during 2011-2012.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Bear case: </strong></span>We assume 15-20% drop in EPS based on our economists鈥� forecast for deeper GDP slowdown under their 鈥榮evere stress鈥� scenario</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/06/04/MS%20brex%202.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/06/04/MS%20brex%202_0.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"606\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>MSCI Europe</strong></span></p>\n<p>The base case view is of a vote for the UK to remain in the EU, and a resulting stock rally. In the tables below MS applies its expected price moves in bull, base and bear scenarios against the underlying index鈥檚 average price level over the last 3 months (note the numbers are virtually identical if compared versus L6M). For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MSCI Europe is currently 4.5% below its L3M average.<br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hence, in the base case view that European equities would fall 15-20% under Brexit, this leaves a further 10.5% to 15.5% to go.</strong></li>\n<li>This implies an index range of between 1070-1137 for MSCI Europe versus the current level of 1278. In the event of a vote to remain MS assumes a 5-10% relief rally. If this upside is applied against the L3M average then it implies upside of between 9.5% and 14.5% in the event the UK votes to remain in the EU. This is equivalent to an index level of between 1405 and 1472.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/06/04/MS%20brex%20MSCI.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/06/04/MS%20brex%20MSCI_0.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"142\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>STOXX 50</strong></span></p>\n<p>Here Morgan Stanley replicates its analysis for the STOXX 50 index.

    Body: "<p>In the aftermath of the tragic murder of British Labour MP Jo Cox, the most poignant - and debated - question that has emerged is whether the shooter, 52-year-old white male Thomas Mair, was motivated by political ideology especially since as some eyewitness have claimed he shouted \"Britain First\" during his deadly attack and is now being probed for \"far-right links\", or if he was simply mentally ill.</p>\n<p>The reason is simple: just like in the aftermath of the mass Orlando shooting, both Brexit camps are trying to score political points by presenting the lone shooter as indicative of the ideology they are trying to protect the UK from.</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"http://take5people.cn:8083/story/aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZXJvaGVkZ2UuY29tL25ld3MvMjAxNi0wNi0xNy9ob3ctYW5nZWxhLW1lcmtlbC10cmllZC1wb2xpdGljaXplLW11cmRlci11ay1sYXdtYWtlci1qby1jb3g=\">reported earlier,</a> none other than Angela Merkel promptly tried to portray the event as an example of \"radicalization\", suggesting that the murder was ideologically provoked: She said that the 鈥渢otal exaggeration and radicalization of the debate doesn鈥檛 contribute to facilitating such respect. So for all of us who value democratic rules, we know how important it is to establish boundaries in one鈥檚 choice of language and argument as well as the choice in a sometimes disparaging way of arguing -- and to engage with respect those who think and believe and love differently... <em>Otherwise it will be difficult to stop radicalization.\"</em></p>\n<p>And while the question of radicalization is certainly relevant, is it fair or event ethical, to bring it up in the aftermath of Cox' murder if the shooter had no rational, ideological motive and was simply insane? The answer will likely never be revealed as every side will use whatever narrative suits it, we do know some facts.</p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/suspect-in-mp-killing-described-as-quiet-polite-and-reserved\">Guardian reported overnight</a>, the picture that emerged of the man known as Tom or Tommy from those who knew him best was of a quiet and caring loner. His half brother, who is mixed race, claimed he had been volunteering at a school for children with disabilities for several years and had never expressed any racist views. Duane St Louis, 41, described his brother as a devoted son who shopped for their mother twice a week and who had visited her on Wednesday night to help tune her TV.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/06/04/Mair.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/06/04/Mair_0.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>St Louis insisted his brother had never expressed any racist views and seemed fine to have a mixed-race sibling. Asked whether he had any strong political views, St Louis said: 鈥淣ot that I know of.鈥� He said he had no idea how Mair had got hold of a gun and did not have any hobbies that would require a firearms licence.</p>\n<p>Mair grew up not with his mother, Mary, but his maternal grandmother, Helen, who died in 1996. The pair lived in a semi-detached house on the Fieldhead estate in Birstall, 15 minutes walk up the hill from where Cox was killed. St Louis said his brother lived alone after their grandmother鈥檚 death and had never married or had children. He had not had a girlfriend for years. 鈥淗e had one girlfriend when he was younger but his mate took her off him and he said he didn鈥檛 want another one,鈥� said St Louis.</p>\n<p>Despite Mair living in the same house for at least 40 years, his neighbours told the Guardian they knew little about him. They said he was quiet and polite, volunteering to do their gardens and offering horticultural tips as he passed down Lowood Lane on his regular strolls into Birstall to use the computers at the library.</p>\n<p>So far the profile is that of an unremarkable, caring man. Alas, there is more.</p>\n<p>As we first reported yesterday, and as the Guardian confirms, <strong>it is believed he had mental health problems and was quoted as praising a particular passage of care he had undertaken in the past.</strong></p>\n<p>In 2011, he was photographed by the local paper volunteering in nearby Oakwell Hall country park. The previous year he was quoted in the Huddersfield Daily Examiner, saying he had begun volunteering after attending Pathways Day Centre for adults with mental health problems.</p>\n<p><strong>鈥淚 can honestly say it has done me more good than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world,鈥� </strong>he said. 鈥淢any people who suffer from mental illness are socially isolated and disconnected from society, feelings of worthlessness are also common, mainly caused by long-term unemployment. 鈥淎ll these problems are alleviated by doing voluntary work. Getting out of the house and meeting new people is a good thing, but more important in my view is doing physically demanding and useful labour.</p>\n<p>\"When you have finished there is a feeling of achievement which is emotionally rewarding and psychologically fulfilling. For people for whom full-time, paid employment is not possible for a variety of reasons, voluntary work offers a socially positive and therapeutic alternative.鈥�</p>\n<p><strong>And then the key punchline which most media have so far largely ignored</strong>: \"The men have another brother, Scott Mair 49, who told reporters he had wept when he heard about the killing. He said: 鈥淚 am struggling to believe what has happened. My brother is not violent and is not all that political. I don鈥檛 even know who he votes for. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">He has a history of mental illness</span>, but he has had help</strong>.鈥�</p>\n<p>It appears not enough help.</p>\n<p>To be sure, mentally unstable or not, there are reports that Muir did express a right-wing ideology and may have been an outright \"<strong>terrorist</strong>\" as the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/17/was-the-man-who-killed-british-mp-jo-cox-a-loner-or-a-terrorist/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-world%3Ahomepage%2Fcard\">WaPo dubs him</a>. As the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/06/uk-mp-jo-cox-attacked/487316/\">Atlantic reports</a>, citing an unconfirmed report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), Mair was a longtime supporter of the National Alliance, a U.S.-based neo-Nazi group. Here鈥檚 <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/06/16/alleged-killer-british-mp-was-longtime-supporter-neo-nazi-national-alliance\">more from the SPLC</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"quote_start\">\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quote_end\">\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p>Mair purchased a manual from the NA in 1999 that included instructions on how to build a pistol.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mair, who resides in what is described as a semi-detached house on the Fieldhead Estate in Birstall, sent just over $620 to the NA, according to invoices for goods purchased from National Vanguard Books, the NA鈥檚 printing imprint. Mair purchased subscriptions for periodicals published by the imprint and he bought works that instruct readers on the 鈥淐hemistry of Powder &amp; Explosives,鈥� 鈥淚ncendiaries,鈥� and a work called 鈥淚mprovised Munitions Handbook.\" Under 鈥淪ection III, No. 9鈥� (page 125) of that handbook, there are detailed instructions for constructing a 鈥淧ipe Pistol For .38 Caliber Ammunition鈥� from components that can be purchased from nearly any hardware store.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Guardian also notes, that Mair's name appears on an extremist website. It describes him as 鈥渙ne of the earliest subscribers and supporters of鈥� a certain extremist publication which is alleged to be linked to white supremacy.</p>\n<p>Then there are the reports of him shouting \"Britain First.\" Graeme Howard, 38, who lives in nearby Bond Street, said: 鈥�<strong>He was shouting 鈥楤ritain first鈥� when he was doing it and being arrested</strong>.鈥� Another witness, Clarke Rothwell, told the Huddersfield Daily Examiner: 鈥淗e was shouting what sounded like 鈥楤ritain first, Britain first鈥� but then seemed to panic and hurried off. He seemed scared and hurried off towards Union Street, dumping a jacket on the floor. I got into my van and tried to follow him but I lost him.鈥�</p>\n<p>But even this may be incomplete. As <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/06/17/britain-first-eyewitness-bnp-member-list/\">Breitbart London reports</a>, \"the eyewitness who insists Jo Cox鈥檚 killer shouted 鈥淏ritain First鈥� before murdering the MP was on the leaked British Nationalist Party (BNP) membership and contacts list. Britain First and the BNP are known to be openly hostile toward one another.\"</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">It appears a spat between the BNP and Britain First may be clouding Jo Cox murder. <a href=\"https://t.co/Iz0yVt2Xro\">https://t.co/Iz0yVt2Xro</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/51eFXzZtat\">pic.twitter.com/51eFXzZtat</a></p>\n<p>鈥� Peter Thompson (@TheRedRag) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRedRag/status/743828856021344256\">June 17, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script><p>The original claim for the 鈥淏ritain First鈥� shout was local dry cleaner Aamir Tahir. In the following hours, however, Mr. Tahir has told other news outlets that he 鈥渨asn鈥檛 there [at the scene]鈥� and simply heard the allegation as second-hand information. Another witness, Hicham Ben Abdallah, has said that he heard no such claim.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is no record of the last witness named in the Guardian 鈥� Graeme Howard 鈥� living in the area, though they claim he lived on Bond Street, just minutes away from the site of the murder. Breitbart London visited Bond Street 鈥� a tiny road 鈥� last night, and could not find Mr. Howard. A sign in a shop window close to where Mrs. Cox was killed insists that 鈥渘o one shouted Britain First鈥� at any time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/06/04/Britain-First.png\"><img src=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/06/04/Britain-First_0.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Others simply deny that Mair ever said \"Britain First\" in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Eyewitness tells reporters he didn't hear anyone shout \"Britain first\", saying: \"Never heard that\". <a href=\"https://t.co/DWhzqe7ayi\">pic.twitter.com/DWhzqe7ayi</a></p>\n<p>鈥� Ben (@Jamin2g) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jamin2g/status/743464352066453504\">June 16, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script><p>To be sure, as we reported yesterday, Britain First spokesman Jayda Fransen distanced her organisation from the attacks, which she called 鈥渁bsolutely disgusting鈥�.</p>\n<p>All this has been sufficient for the UK police to say they have begun probing Mair's far-right links.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash\">#BREAKING</a> UK police say probing far-right links of MP murder suspect</p>\n<p>鈥� AFP news agency (@AFP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFP/status/743853110234390528\">June 17, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script><p>As <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-attack-suspect-idUSKCN0Z313I\">Reuters writes</a>, \"police were investigating Mair's political affiliations following witness accounts that the suspect shouted \"Britain first\" as he launched the attack.\"</p>\n<p>And while the police should certainly probe whether or not Mair acted out due to ideological reasons, what is surprising is the almost mirror image to the Cox muder versus that of the Mateen mass shooting, by members of both the press and authorities. After all, only \"fringe\" voices have dared to accuse Mateen of being a \"radicalized Islamist\", while less than a day later Angela Merkel was throwing around the word \"radicalization\" in connection to the Cox shooting as if the motive was already known.</p>\n<p>Here Glenn Greenwald <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/06/17/why-is-the-killer-of-british-mp-jo-cox-not-being-called-a-terrorist/\">makes an interesting observation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"quote_start\">\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quote_end\">\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p>I鈥檓 glad when the media withhold judgment about a killer鈥檚 motives or goals before there is sufficient evidence to know that with reasonable certainty. I have no particular objection to their refraining from applying the 鈥渢errorist鈥� label to Cox鈥檚 killer before more evidence is available. And, as I said, the term 鈥渢errorist鈥� at this point has so little cogent meaning that debates about how to apply it seem quaint and completely academic. The scholars Remi Brulin and&nbsp;Lisa Stampnitzky&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/03/14/brulin/\">have spent years documenting</a>&nbsp;how the term, from the start, was <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/br/academic/subjects/sociology/political-sociology/disciplining-terror-how-experts-invented-terrorism\">little more than a propaganda tool</a> designed to legitimize one side鈥檚 violence while delegitimizing its&nbsp;enemies鈥� violence.&nbsp; The issue is that this journalistic restraint is extremely selective. Does anyone have any doubt at all that if Cox鈥檚 suspected killer&nbsp;had been Muslim, yelling 鈥淎llah Akbar鈥� instead of 鈥淏ritain First,鈥� then every media outlet on the planet would be describing him forever as a 鈥渢errorist鈥�? The fact that they are not doing so here sheds great light into what this word really is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Greenwald may be right... if Mair indeed did yell that key phrase, as many have suggested never happened.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Whatever the true reason behind Mair's attack, it will likely not be revealed in time before the Brexit vote next week, unless said vote is postponed, speculation of which morbidly served as the catalyst to send risk assets soaring yesterday coupled with speculation that the backlash over the \"Britain First\" shouting \"terrorist\" would sway the Brexit campaign to the side of \"Remain.\"</p>\n<p>In the meantime, as we said at the start, expect both Brexit camps to distort this tragic event in a way that allows both to \"score political points\" by presenting the lone shooter in whatever light best serves their agenda. Hypocritical or not, even this skewing of reality may be too late as by now it is far more likely than not that enough people have made up their minds how they will vote in less than six days.</p>\n<p>As for tragic events like the Cox murder, we can only hope that they will not be used for political purposes in the future as that would only serve to encourage more violence and death. We will be disappointed.</p>\n\n\n</div>"
